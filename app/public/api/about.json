  "body" : "<p>Flappy <span class=\"bird\">Bird</span> is a side-scrolling mobile game featuring 2D retro style graphics. The objective is to direct a flying <span class=\"bird\">bird</span>, named &ldquo;Faby&rdquo;, which moves continuously to the right, between sets of Mario-like pipes. If the player touches the pipes, it ends the game. The <span class=\"bird\">bird</span> briefly flaps upward each time the player taps the screen; if the screen is not tapped, the <span class=\"bird\">bird</span> falls due to gravity. The player is scored based on the number of pipe sets that the <span class=\"bird\">bird</span> successfully passes through, with medals awarded for the score at the end of the game.</p>"
