  "body" : "<p>Dong Nguyen grew up in Vạn Phúchuc, a village near Hanoi. He discovered video games by playing Super Mario Bros. as a child, and began coding his own at age 16. At 19, while studying programming at a local university, he won an internship at Punch Entertainment, one of the few video game companies in Vietnam. While using the iPhone, he found that its most popular games such as Angry Birds were too complicated, and wanted to make a simpler game for people who are \"always on the move\".</p> <p>Flappy Bird was created and developed by Nguyen in two to three days. The bird character was originally designed in 2012 for a cancelled platform game. Ngyuen said that no part of any of his games were designed to be impossible. He described the business plan of a free download with in-game advertisements as \"very common in the Japanese market\".</p> <p>Nguyen believes that contemporary Western games are overly complex. His company, .GEARS (dotGears) Studios, describes its games as \"heavily influenced by retro pixelated games in its golden age. Everything is pure, extremely hard and incredibly fun to play.\" .GEARS is small, independent and based in Vietnam.</p>"
